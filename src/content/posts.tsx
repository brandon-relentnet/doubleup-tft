          Free-range play is about tending your board like a small farm—rotate
          crops, respect the soil, and harvest when the timing is right. Farm
          Fresh TFT lays out the habits that keep our lineups crisp even when
          the meta wilts.
        </Lead>
        <Paragraph>
          Start by scouting the lobby every carousel. If everyone chases the
          same 4-cost headliner, switch rows and let them fight over scraps.
          Like any good harvest, diversification keeps you safe from blight.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          Economy is your irrigation. Hold 30 gold whenever the board can
          stomach it, then burst spend on key stages (3-2, 4-1, 5-1). Fertilize
          those spikes with well-timed item slams—waiting for “perfect” best in
          slot is the same as letting crops rot on the field.

          The goal is not perfection—it is sustainable growth. Play with

          basket of fresh tomatoes on the counter. That is farm fresh TFT.

          Thanks for stopping by! DoubleUp TFT is my spot for sharing notes,
          comps, and general Teamfight Tactics learnings. Expect breakdowns of
          new sets, usable cheat sheets, and honest reflections on what works
          (and what definitely does not) on the ranked ladder.

          Opening weeks are chaotic, but that chaos is where you can gain free

            Lean on tempo in Stage 2 by slamming every reasonable item. Edge out

          <ListItem>
            Scout every carousel. So many players tunnel vision into their
            fantasy comp; you only need to grab the best-in-slot to cripple
            them.

            Don&apos;t be afraid of 4-cost carries, but make sure you can pivot
            into a 3-cost reroll fallback if shops stay dry.

          My go-to opener is a Bruiser frontline with angle into either a
          Tactician Reckoner board or a Sentinel flex line. Keep an eye on AP
          lobbies—Ion Spark is still a cheat code.

          Playing Double Up well means micromanaging two economies while keeping
          track of four enemy boards. It sounds impossible, but a lightweight
          checklist makes the chaos manageable. Run through these scans at the
          start of every stage and you will anchor your teams without feeling
          rushed.

            Spend down if either board drops below 50 HP. Preserving both nexus

        <Paragraph>
          Late-game fights hinge on positioning. Alternate who takes lead on
          the scouting pass so one person can focus on execution. When you spot
          an angle that beats both opponents, call it and swap quickly—hesitation
          is how you lose to shifter comps.

        <Paragraph>
          Screenshot this list or jot it on a sticky note near your monitor.
          The goal is consistency: when every stage has a purpose, you avoid
          panic rolls and keep both inventories clean. Combine it with your own
          role delegation and you will feel in control even during scramble
          lobbies.
